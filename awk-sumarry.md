## What is awk

The model of awk is very similar to sed, which is also oriented for line. You can apply your program to each line of a file. 

The program of awk can be divided into two parts. The first part is pattern, which can be used to line matching. The second part is procedure, which is a program applied to the line. 

Almost all the thing done in sed can also be  done in awk, however ,awk is usually used in  data reporting and data statistics, such as average, median and sum. 

## The procedure part. 

The procedure part can be divided into three parts.
